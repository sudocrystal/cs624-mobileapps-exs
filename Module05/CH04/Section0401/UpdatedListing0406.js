// Listing 4.6 Application that toggles between light and dark themes
/*
    The application has a single button on the screen. 
    That button is enclosed by a small square box. 
    When the button is pressed, the themes will toggle. 
    When the light theme is selected, the button label will say White, the background will be white, and the box around the button will be black. 
    When the dark theme is selected, the button label will say Black, the background will be black, and the box around the button will be white. 
    
    Try changing the light theme to a different color. Notice how easy it is, because the colors are defined as constants in one place. 
    Try changing the button label in the dark theme to be the same color as the background instead of always white.
